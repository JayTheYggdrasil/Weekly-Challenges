# Guidlines
 When devoloping use "rlbottraining run_module ./simple_training.py" from console located in the appropriate challenge folder (We'll call this developer mode).
 Make sure your bot works on both teams if your going to submit it to the official leaderboard for the challenge
 Do not rename appearance.cfg, it makes my life harder when I grade things for the leaderboards, thanks
